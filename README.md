There is a Normalization Python file where different metrics are added to the database.
The final database to use is real_data_1.xlsx where the Power BI file read it.

It's not complete, because I prefer to use Python. Power BI is not a good tool to make those kinds of things.
If the job is mostly building dashboards in Power BI, I prefer to reject it.
Thanks.
